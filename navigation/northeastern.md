<h1>Looking Ahead: My Journey to Northeastern University</h1>

<section>
<p>As I prepare to embark on the next chapter of my academic and professional life, I’m beyond excited to announce that I’ll be attending <strong>Northeastern University</strong>!</p>
<p>With its top-tier academics, supportive community, and renowned co-op program, I know Northeastern is the perfect place to turn my aspirations into reality.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>My Intended Major</h2>
<p>I’m thrilled to be pursuing <strong>Computer Science + Biology</strong>, a combined major that merges my passion for technology with the life sciences. I’m fascinated by how computational methods can revolutionize healthcare, genomics, and drug discovery. Northeastern’s approach will allow me to dive into areas like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bioinformatics and systems biology</li>
    <li>Machine learning in medical research</li>
    <li>Data science applications in public health</li>
</ul>
<p>This major will empower me to tackle real-world problems at the intersection of computer science and biology, helping build solutions that improve lives.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Co-op Advantage</h2>
<p>What truly sets Northeastern apart is its <strong>renowned co-op program</strong>—a full-time, paid, professional experience integrated into the academic curriculum. Through co-ops, I’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Work for industry-leading companies like Moderna, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, or Mass General Brigham</li>
    <li>Gain real-world experience as early as my sophomore year</li>
    <li>Graduate with a competitive edge and a robust professional network</li>
</ul>
<p>Co-ops aren’t just internships—they’re immersive career-building experiences. I’ll get to try out different roles, from bioinformatics research to software engineering in healthcare, and develop skills that align with my passion for technology and the life sciences.</p>

<h2>Showcasing My Work: The “Take A Byte” Project</h2>
<p>One project I’m particularly proud of is <strong>"Take A Byte"</strong>, a coding project I helped build this year. The project involved:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Developing an interactive website where users can find recipes and cooking ideas tailored to their personal needs</li>
    <li>Implementing a clean and responsive UI using HTML, Python, and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Focusing on accessibility and user engagement through thoughtful UX design</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to feature <em>Take A Byte</em> prominently on my resume and GitHub profile. It reflects not only my technical skills but also my commitment to building tools that make life easier and more enjoyable. I believe this project will help me stand out when applying for co-op roles in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Healthcare technology startups</li>
    <li>Front-end or full-stack developer positions</li>
    <li>Bioinformatics and health data research teams</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Growth Journey</h2>
<p>This year wasn’t always easy—but every challenge taught me something invaluable.</p>
<div class="highlight">
    <h3>Late Start Challenges</h3>
    <p>I joined the school year after it had already begun, so I felt behind as others had already started projects and gotten familiar with tools. I had to quickly catch up on classroom expectations and new technology concepts.</p>

    <h3>Struggles with CRUD Operations</h3>
    <p>At first, I was confused by CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and struggled to link frontend inputs to backend routes and databases. Bugs and logic errors were frequent—especially with updates and deletes.</p>

    <h3>Learning GitHub & VS Code</h3>
    <p>GitHub basics—like commits, branches, and pull requests—were initially overwhelming. Merge conflicts and version control issues left me frustrated at times. VS Code extensions and settings felt intimidating, but with patience, I became more confident using Git and debugging in the terminal.</p>
</div>

<h2>Growth Over Time</h2>
<p>Despite the bumps, I gradually developed muscle memory for common commands and workflows. I got better at reading documentation and asking for help when stuck. Collaborating with peers and contributing to group projects became more natural.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Connecting to My Future</h2>
<p>Now I’m applying what I learned in class to my engineering interests. My skills in Git, Python, and version control have become essential in a hands-on engineering project I’m working on. CRUD knowledge is helping me manage data in a prototype system. It’s exciting to see how these foundational skills bridge the gap between coding and real-world innovation—especially as I aim to apply them in the life sciences.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Our Engineering Project</h2>
<p>This trimester, I also had the opportunity to work on a collaborative engineering project: a web-based platform designed to help students explore engineering fields through interest-based matching and a project tracker backed by a parts and project database. Although the project didn’t work out as well as we had hoped, I’m proud of the effort my team put into it and I hope future students can build on this idea and make it even better.</p>

<h2>Diving into my Linkedin</h2>

<p>This year was tough, but I wouldn’t change it. I learned more from failures than from successes. I’m proud to end the trimester by turning confusion into creation—taking every challenge as an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>As I look ahead to Northeastern University, I’m filled with excitement, curiosity, and determination. I can’t wait to apply everything I’ve learned so far—and to build on it—so I can make a meaningful impact in technology and the life sciences.</p>
