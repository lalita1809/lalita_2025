## SUMMARY OF 3.8 ##

### - For Loops: Used when you know how many times the loop should run.###
### - While Loops: Used when the loop should run until a condition becomes false.###
### -Do-While Loops:  Runs at least once, then checks the condition.###
### -Index Loops: A variation of for loops, used when you need access to the index.###
### -Break and Continue: Controls the loop flow by either stopping the loop (break) or skipping to the next iteration.###
