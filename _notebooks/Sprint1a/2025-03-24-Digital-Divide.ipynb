    "A field where I have observed the digital divide in effect is education. Students from low-income households frequently struggle with access to high-speed internet and personal devices, hindering their ability to finish assignments or participate in virtual classes. Conversely, students from affluent families benefit from superior technology, tutoring, and educational resources, which provide them with a considerable edge. This separation generates disparities in educational results, future prospects, and overall academic achievement. The enduring impacts can maintain cycles of poverty, as digital skills are becoming more crucial for higher education and job opportunities.\n",

    "Facial recognition technology is a computing advancement that may unintentionally marginalize specific groups. This technology has demonstrated biases against individuals with darker skin tones because of insufficient diverse training data. It can also disadvantage individuals lacking government-issued identification, like undocumented immigrants, which makes it more challenging for them to obtain digital services. Moreover, older adults who are not accustomed to this technology may find it difficult to operate systems that depend on facial recognition for security purposes. This exclusion strengthens systemic disparities and restricts chances for communities that are already marginalized\n",

    "In my community, numerous low-income families lack access to dependable internet, making it challenging for students to finish homework and for adults to seek jobs online. Rural regions encounter connectivity challenges, restricting residents' chances to work remotely, utilize telehealth services, or participate in online education. Public libraries and community centers offer some access to technology, but their hours and resources are frequently limited, creating difficulties for those who require it most. To address this issue, I can increase awareness by talking about these matters with community leaders and promoting enhanced broadband access in underserved regions. Furthermore, I can assist or engage with community initiatives that offer free digital literacy education and accessible technology to individuals who require it.\n",

    "Changing the order of coins impacted the result by influencing which coins were chosen first, especially in greedy algorithms that prioritize larger denominations. The greedy algorithm often used fewer coins when the coin values aligned well with the target amount, but it could fail in cases where smaller denominations provided a more optimal solution. This showed that while greedy methods are fast and simple, they don’t always guarantee the best outcome for every situation."

    "## Why is there an undecidable problem here?\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, an **undecidable problem** is one where no algorithm can determine the answer in all possible cases. In the context of our **Pilot City project**, an undecidable problem could appear when our website or program takes too long to load or never finishes loading at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might happen due to issues like:\n",
    "- An infinite loop in the code\n",
    "- A recursive function with no proper base case\n",
    "- Trying to solve a problem that is computationally impossible to fully check (like the Halting Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the program may **never complete**, or your computer may **stop running the process** altogether—this is a real-world symptom of encountering an undecidable or non-terminating situation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**:  \n",
    "Undecidable problems remind us that not all programming issues can be solved with more code—some have no guaranteed solution, and that’s a limitation of computation itself.\n"
