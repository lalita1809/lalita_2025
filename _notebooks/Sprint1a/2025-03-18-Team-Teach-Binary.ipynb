    "**Binary Search** is a fast and efficient algorithm used to find an element in a **sorted** list.  \n",
    "It works by **repeatedly dividing the search range in half**:\n",

    "1. Start with the entire list.\n",
    "2. Look at the **middle element**.\n",
    "3. Compare it to your **target**:\n",
    "   - ✅ If it matches → you're done!\n",
    "   - ◀️ If the target is **less than** the middle → search the **left half**.\n",
    "   - ▶️ If the target is **greater than** the middle → search the **right half**.\n",
    "4. Repeat until the element is found or the list is exhausted.\n",
